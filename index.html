            <p>Hello! I am a first-year computer science student at Georgia Tech, and I am passionate about using technology for social good. In the past, I have worked to serve the tech community through numerous organizations and initiatives, however I believe Bits of Good will be a unique experience that will allow me to channel my passions for technology and service. In my free time, I enjoy dancing, singing, and creating art!</p>
